5.5 Gameplay Systems

      * Long falls made with no attempt to break the fall resets avatar momentum.
      * If hit by a power up or hazard the player will be stunned.
   * Elastic grappling hook
      * The player can use their grapple freely, but they cannot cancel the firing animation and they our locked into the action being performed with said hook until the action is completed. 
      * Controlled swings while grappling (reference pathfinder Apex Legends)
      * Air Control while falling, jumping or gliding.
      * Hook length 14 meters. (be serializable)
      * Pull Force. (must be serializable)
      * Dynamic grapple speed based on the players current movement speed.
   * Slide ability 
      * Player can slide on the ground, this can be used to maintain their momentum, whereas simply landing and running will slow them down.
   * Wall jump
      * Instead of grappling to objects above them and swinging past, player may choose to grapple towards a wall and jump off it, or approach and jump off.
   * Wall running
      * A player should be able to run towards a wall and jump to initiate a wall run.
   * Rocket Jump        
      * The player can use a second jump that allows the avatar to be moved on any axis.
      * The second jump will affect the avatar’s momentum, often trading speed for maneuverability. 
   * Gliding / Diving
      * During long falls the player picks up momentum and motion blur is utilized to clarify that they are diving.
      * The diving/ gliding state will have its own unique animation.

Section 7 - Development
________________


7.1 Design & Scope
The full development phase of Hangtime would last 30 weeks and the team will consist of a core of six developers. One project manager, one designer, two-character artist, one environment artist, and one programmer. We are considering expanding the team if one more programmer or designer with programming skills can be found. However, the assistance of an additional artist would be welcome also. Largely this game will be leaning on the art our team can produce to dictate the direction of our work. Because we will have to put a lot of effort into interesting character designs and level design much of the risk and challenges involved with this project is design and art challenges. 
7.2 Updates/Changes
*  06-29-2019
   * Added chase system description to  Section 5 (Gameplay Features) under subsection 5.5 (Gameplay Systems).
*  07-16-2019
   * Removed unlockable content from section 5 (Gameplay Features) under subsection 5.4. This is done to lower the scope of the project.
*  08-18-2019
   * Interactive loading area added into section 5 (Gameplay Features) under subsection 5.4. This was done in order to provide opportunities for the player to treat the game as a toy, and encourage additional interaction with the content.
