Gobby Gobbins (Goblin Announcer)

**Client:** NDA Interactive (Hangtime)

**Voice Age:** Adult

**Voice Type:** Masculine

**Job Description:** Hangtime is a science fiction racing/ platforming game that puts players in the shoes of one of a select few racers in the intergalactic swing racing competition. The whole galaxy is watching to see who out of this small group of talented athletes will be the next king of swing! The game seeks to create a sense of whimsy and freedom for its players though the humor and fun movement mechanics.

**Genre:** Racing

**Art Direction:** Gobby is meant to be a parody of a tradition sports announcer. Frequently making silly nonsensical comments almost completely divorced from what&#39;s happening in game. Also he is a space goblin, and he speaks with a scratchy almost [Gollum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum) like tone. He is excitable, eccentric, and spirited.  A strong reference for this characters behavior would be [John Henson from the tv show &quot;Wipeout&quot;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tYx8GcP864).

Follow Orb K1-55

**Client:** NDA Interactive (Hangtime)

**Voice Age:** Adult

**Voice Type:** Robotic Feminine

**Job Description:** Hangtime is a science fiction racing/ platforming game that puts players in the shoes of one of a select few racers in the intergalactic swing racing competition. The whole galaxy is watching to see who out of this small group of talented athletes will be the next king of swing! The game seeks to create a sense of whimsy and freedom for its players though the humor and fun movement mechanics.

**Genre:** Racing

**Art Direction:** K1-55 is the follow orb, the very thing that guides the players though the race and she talks! She is an AI that is both Gobby&#39;s broadcasting partner and the machine that the racers must keep up with if they want to win! She is a much more soft spoken and focused presence in the race although she seems to enjoy her work a bit too much, coming off as teasing, playful, and even a bit flirty while trying to remind the racers and viewers at home that she is a emotionless machine that is simply following her programming. Her voice should have a robotic tone to it, reminiscent of [Glados from the portal series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5kkwermfs4).

**Style(s):**[Flirty](https://www.voices.com/voice-actors/style/flirty), [Passive Aggressive](https://www.voices.com/voice-actors/style/passive-aggressive), &amp; [Snarky](https://www.voices.com/voice-actors/style/snarky).

- Oh, look at you trying so hard to keep up with me. That&#39;s adorable!
- Following the leader, the leader, the leader, following the leader wherever she may go!
- Be careful, I bite. I may not have teeth but trust me on this one. Okay?

Hawkman (AKA: Songbird)

**Client:** NDA Interactive (Hangtime)

**Voice Age:** Adult

**Voice Type:** Masculine with a hint of femininity

**Job Description:** Hangtime is a science fiction racing/ platforming game that puts players in the shoes of one of a select few racers in the intergalactic swing racing competition. The whole galaxy is watching to see who out of this small group of talented athletes will be the next king of swing! The game seeks to create a sense of whimsy and freedom for its players though the humor and fun movement mechanics.

**Genre:** Racing

**Art Direction:** The Songbird is a swing race veteran and he is in it for the love and admiration of the fans more than anything else. His style of dress and every movement is flashy and draws the attention of others. Songbird likes to stand out, and he understands that wining isn&#39;t the only way to do that. He speaks with a melodious tone, while carrying himself with elegance and confidence that I&#39;d compare to the likes of [David Bowie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDkp7GysvbY).

- This is such an exquisite piece!
- Time for someone&#39;s curtain call!

Hello intergalactic space race lovers! Today we have a fun show lined up for you!

Today we will be streaming directly from the desert of doom, and don&#39;t worry, this time we have taken precautions to make sure everybody makes it home with minimum injuries at worst.

\*Suspicious giggling\*

As usual I&#39;m here with everyone&#39;s favorite follow orb K1-55!

What can we expect today from our racers K1?

**K1-55**

Today I&#39;ll be chased though a desert in extremely hazardous weather conditions. We have the finest of our racers today ready to put everything on the line for a chance at a win. All of this seems like a bad idea to meâ€¦ But I&#39;m just some machine, with top-of-the-line risk analysis circuits, so what do I know.

You don&#39;t know much K1, we would have some serious problems if you did!

Either way we have a fun track here today, wide open desert full of rolling hills and plateaus. Perfect for some old-fashioned swingin&#39;!
